# Tour-Guide

This is an app that displays popular tourist locations in Niagara and London Ontario. This is an app i built to sharpen my knowledge of Material-UI v5 and i had a lot of fun creating the mock content as well. 

## Requirements
For development, you will need `node` and `npm` installed on your local machine.

## Installation and Setup Instructions
In terminal or command prompt,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/junior231/Tour_Guide_App.git 
```
```bash
cd PROJECT directory
```
Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install dependencies.

```bash
npm install 
```
or 

```bash
yarn add 
```
After installing the dependencies, to start server:

```bash
npm run start
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Languages & tools
- React 
- Material UI v5
- React-Redux (an overkill for such a litte project but helpful for app-wide state management)
